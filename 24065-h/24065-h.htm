<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Without</span> advancing any theory
touching the progression of the
mother's song to her babe, other than
declaring lullabies to be about as old as
babies, a statement which recalls to mind
an old story, entitled "The Owl's Advice
to an Inquisitive Cat."</p>

<p>"O cat," said the sage owl of the legend,
"to pass life agreeably most of all you need
a philosophy; you and I indeed enjoy many
things in common, especially night air and
mice, yet you sadly need a philosophy to
search after, and think about matters most
difficult to discover." After saying this the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
owl ruffled his feathers and pretended to
think.</p>

<p>But the cat observed that it was foolish
to search after such things. "Indeed," she
purringly said, "I only trouble about easy
matters."</p>

<p>"Ah! I will give you an example of my
philosophy, and how inquiry ought to be
made. You at least know, I presume,"
scoffingly exclaimed the owl, "that the
chicken arises from the egg, and the egg
comes from the hen. Now the object of
true philosophy is to examine this statement
in all its bearings, and consider which
was first, the egg or the bird."</p>

<p>The cat was quite struck with the proposition.</p>

<p>"It is quite clear," went on the owl, "to
all but the ignorant, one or other appeared
first, since neither is immortal."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>

<p>The cat inquired, "Do you find out this
thing by philosophy?"</p>

<p>"Really! how absurd of you to ask,"
concluded the feathered one. "And I
thank the gods for it, were it as you
suggest, O cat, philosophy would give no
delight to inquirers, for knowing all things
would mean the end and destruction of
philosophy."</p>

<p>With this owl's apology nursery-lore is
presented to my readers without the legion
of verified references of that character demanded
as corroborative evidence in the
schools of criticism to-day.</p>

<p>A few leading thoughts culled from
such men as Tylor, Lubbock, Wilson,
McLennan, Frazer, and Boyd Dawkins,
etc., the experiences of our modern
travellers among primitive races, Indian
and European folk-lore, the world's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
credulities past and present, have helped
me to fix the idea that amongst the true
historians of mankind the children of our
streets find a place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pub1">"The scene was savage, but the scene was new."</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Scientists</span> tell us many marvellous
tales, none the less true because marvellous,
about the prehistoric past. Like
the owl in the preface, they are not discouraged
because the starting-point is beyond
reach; and we, like the cat, should
try to awaken our interest when evidences
are presented to us that on first hearing
sound like the wonderful tales of the
Orient.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Thousands of years ago in our own land
dwelt two races of people, the River Drift-men
and the Cave-dwellers. The River
Drift-man was a hunter of a very low order,
possessing only the limited intelligence of
the modern Australian native. This man
supported life much in the same way we
should expect a man to do, surrounded by
similar conditions; but, on the other hand,
the Cave-dweller showed a singular talent for
representing the animals he hunted, and his
sketches reveal to us the capacity he had
for seeing the beauty and grace of natural
objects. Were a visit to be paid to the
British Museum, his handicraft, rude when
compared to modern art, could be seen in
the fragments beyond all cavil recording his
primitive culture.</p>

<p>Without, then, any very great stretch of
imagination we can picture to ourselves this
man as belonging to one of the most primitive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
types of our race, having little occasion
to use a vocabulary&mdash;save of a most meagre
order; and indeed his language would embody
only a supply of words just expressive
of his few simple wants. Without daring
to compare primitive culture with modern
advancement, this prototype's appetites would
have been possibly served for the greater
part by sign-language, and the use of a few
easy protophones. To-day, after the lapse
of ages since this Second Stone Age, man
went up and possessed the land; we with our
new inventions, wants, and newly-acquired
tastes have added a legion of scientifically
constructed sounds, built up on the foundation
he laid with his first utterances, for
language is not the outcome of race, but
of social contact. As an interpolation the
tale of the Egyptian Psammetichus is worth
telling at this stage.</p>

<p>Desirous of finding&mdash;as the ancients then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
thought existed&mdash;the original language of
mankind, Psammetichus isolated two babies
from birth in separate apartments, and for
two years they were not allowed to hear
the sound of a human voice. At the end of
that time they were brought together and
kept for a few hours without food. Psammetichus
then entered the room, and both
children uttered the same strange cry, "Becos,
Becos." "Ah!" said Psammetichus, "'Becos,
Becos,' why! that is Phrygian for bread,"
and Phrygian was said to have been the
ancient universal language of man. Still,
however one feels disposed to imagine what
took place in the Baby Kingdom of these
remote ages, brief allusions only will be
made to the veiled past, when either sign-language,
or relics, or myths of long descent
are presented to us in the form of nursery-lore.</p>

<p>How many thousands of years have gone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
by since the period known to scientists as
the Pleistocene was here&mdash;a time when the
whole of Britain and North-West Europe
wore a glistening mantle of ice, and when
man could scarce exist, save on the fringe
of the south-east littoral of England&mdash;none
can say. At all events it may be safely
assumed that not till the end of the
Pleistocene Era was Britain or Scandinavia
the abode of man, when the fauna and flora
assumed approximately their present condition,
and the state of things called Recent
by geologists set in.</p>

<p>Whether the Aryans be accepted as the
first people to inhabit our ice-bound shores
in the remote past matters little, and from
whence they sprang (according to Max
M&uuml;ller "somewhere in Asia," or Dr.
Schrader "European Russia," or Herr
Penka "from the east to the far west of
the Scandinavian Peninsula") matters still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
less, "for," says Professor Huxley, "the
speakers of primitive Aryan may have
been (themselves) a mixture of two or
more races, just as are the speakers of
English or of French at the present time";
and arch&aelig;ology takes us no further back
than into the Neolithic or Second Stone
Age, when the poetry of the human voice
gave a dramatic value to the hitherto
primitive sign-language limitation of the
Old Drift-men. At this age, the Neolithic,
arithmetical questions arising in the course
of life would necessarily assume a vocal
value instead of a digital one. No longer
would fifteen be counted by holding out
ten fingers and five toes, but an idiomatic
phrase, descriptive of the former sign-language,
"<i>of two hands and one foot's
worth</i>" would be used, just as to-day an
African would express the same problem
in a number of cows, and as the comparatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
modern Roman used such pictorial
phrases as "<i>to condemn a person of his
head</i>." From this era, centuries before the
Celt traversed our shores, "the progress of
civilisation" has gone on in one unbroken
continuity from the Second Stone Age man
to the present time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><div class="chp1"><p>"O dea, si prima repetens ab origine pergam et vacet annales
nostrorum audire laborum. Ante diem clauso componat
Vesper Olympo."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vergil</span>, <i>&AElig;neid</i>, Book I. 372.</p>

<p>"O goddess, if I were to proceed retracing them from their
first origin, and thou hadst leisure to hear the records of
our labours before (the end), the Evening Star would
lull the day to rest, Olympus being closed."</p></div></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">However</span>, granting the scientific
imagination to assume a starting-point
when the vast Ice Period was vanishing
and language was not the test of race,
but of social contact, it must be allowed
that the River Drift-man was the first of
his species that touched our shores, followed
by the Cave-dwellers some thousands of
years later; the latter man having his
abode fixed to a locality, and his wanderings
within prescribed limits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>He may have, this prehistoric man, this
Cave-dweller, chattered like a monkey in a
patois understood only by his own family;
but what is more reasonable to suppose than
that the Drift-men of the marshes and coastlines
had only a restricted use for vocal
sounds, sign-language being expressive
enough to meet their few wants? Meagre
social conditions, peculiar isolation, savagery,
strife for life, call for no complex language,
but sign-language has the authority of
people living on the globe to-day, not only
amongst uncivilised races, but traces are
seen in our very midst.</p>

<p>The few examples of custom and signs
given below will better illustrate the force
of the statement.</p>

<p>"Amongst the Uvinza, when two grandees
meet, the junior leans forward, bends his
knees, and places the palms of his hands
on the ground, one on either side his feet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
while the senior claps hands over him six
or seven times."</p>

<p>In the morning among the Walunga all
the villagers turn out, and a continuous
clapping is kept up to the vocalisation of
a shrill "Kwi-tata?" or "How do you
do?"</p>

<p>Two special signs for "good" are in the
sign-vocabulary of the North American
Indians, and are worth recording. The
person greeting holds the right hand, back
up, in front of and close to the heart, with
the fingers extended and pointing to the
left. Another habit is that of passing the
open right hand, palm downwards, from the
heart, towards the person greeted. A
stranger making his appearance on the
frontier line of an Indian camp seldom fails
to recognise the true sentiment of the chief's
salutation, the extended fingers on the
left side meaning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are near my heart&mdash;expect no
treachery," a most solemn surety; while
the hand sent from the heart towards the
visitor seems to say&mdash;</p>

<p>"I extend hospitality to you."</p>

<p>The "attingere extremis digitis" of the
Romans expressed the same temperate
conduct.</p>

<p>But greeting by gesture and hand-clapping
still live, and are discovered in the first
lessons given by a mother to her babe.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 13em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Clap hands, papa comes,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pat a cake, pat a cake, my little man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, I will, mother, as fast as I can"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>have a universal significance in Child Land.
Unfortunately this survival of hand-clapping,
a vestige of a habit belonging to primitive
people, does not begin and end in our
modern nursery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"When I was a child I spake as a child,
but when I became a man I put away
childish things," is a resolve daily forgotten.</p>

<p>In the theatre, when our sentiment is
awakened by the craft of the stage player,
we show approbation by a round of hand-clapping
not one whit less savage than the
habit of the Uvinza grandee or the good-morning
among the Walunga tribe.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O wad some Power the giftie gie us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see oursels as others see us!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This demonstration of feeling may have
more <i>corps d'esprit</i> than the feeble "hear,
hear" of the educated or self-restrained man,
but sign-language, especially among the
Anglo-Saxon race, is on the wane. Its
exodus is slowly going on, lingering anon
in the ritual of religions, yet in social life
ever being expelled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is rude to point," says the nursemaid
to her little charge.</p>

<p>"Is it rude to shake hands, nurse?" once
exclaimed a child cynic. The nurse was nonplussed.
The middle-class mother answers
the child's question&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, dear&mdash;with anyone in a lower
position."</p>

<p>"That's a case," said an Irishman on
hearing it, "of twopence-halfpenny looking
down on twopence," or by another comparison,
it is a case of one English grandee
clapping his hands over another grandee's
head. Still, though educational influences
and nine-tenths of the coterie of society wage
war against sign-language, ill-mannered men
and badly-behaved children must always
be with us.</p>

<p>"'Tis rude to laugh" is another precept
of the hypercritical mother. Why? Goodness
only knows!&mdash;for none but a pompous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
blockhead or a solemn prig will pretend
that he never relaxes. But let ancient
Plato, brimful as he was of philosophy,
answer the question "When not to laugh?"</p>

<p>Indulging one day in idle waggery, Plato,
on seeing a staid disciple approach, suddenly
exclaimed to his fellows, "Let's be wise
now, for I see a fool coming," and under
hypocrisy's mask all merriment ceased.</p>

<p>Agesilaus in mere sport romped with his
children, and delighted them by riding on
a stick round the nursery, possibly singing,
after the manner of many a modern rollicking
nursery-loving father&mdash;</p>

<p>With men, however, kingly proclamations,
laws, empires pass away and are forgotten,
time obliterates their memories, but in Child
Land all the inhabitants, from the tiniest
crower to the ten-year-old boy, show an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
eager appreciation in the conservation of
the pleasing lore contained in the lullabies,
the jingles, the tales, the riddles, the
proverbs, and the games of the nursery
classics.</p>

<p>And what terrible critics these babies
are! What a perverse preference they

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="chp1"><div class="cpoem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The moon is up; by Heaven, a lovely eve!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long streams of light o'er dancing waves expand."<br /></span>
</div></div></div></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Norwegian explorer, Dr. Nansen,
in his address to the Royal Geographical
Society on February 9th, 1897,
stated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The long Arctic day was beautiful in
itself, though one soon got tired of it. But
when that day vanished and the long Polar
night began, then began the kingdom of
beauty, then they had the moon sailing
through the peculiar silence of night and
day. The light of the moon shining when
all was marble had a most singular effect."<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>Writers on Comparative Religions for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
most part assert that moon worship amongst
the almost utterly savage tribes in Africa
and America, the hunting, nomad races of
to-day, is a noteworthy feature. "It is not
the sun that first attracted the attention of
the savage."<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> "In order of birth the
worship of the night sky, inclusive of that
of the moon, precedes that of the day sky
and the sun. It was observed long ago
that wherever sun worship existed moon
worship was to be found, being a residuum
of an earlier state of religion."<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>What the early primal melody of thousands
of years ago may have been one
can hardly suggest, but that the subject-matter
of the song was mythical there
can be very little doubt, and, like folk-lore
tales, built upon and around nature worship;
for as the capacity for creating language<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
does not exhaust all its force at once, but
still continues to form new modes of speech
whenever an alteration of circumstances
demands them, so it is with myths. The
moon during a long Polar night reigning
in a kingdom of crystalline beauty, when
all around is silence and grandeur, would
suggest to the dweller on the fringe of
the ice fields&mdash;his deity. The sun, in like
manner shedding forth its genial warmth,
the agriculturist would learn to welcome,
and to ascribe to its power the increase of
his crop, and just as the limitation of reason
holds the untutored man in bondage, so the
myth, the outcome of his ignorance, becomes
his god.</p>

<p>Even though social advancement has
made rapid strides among comparatively
modern peoples and nations, not only
traces of mythological, but entire religious
observances, reclothed in Christian costumes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
are still kept up. Praying to an
apple tree to yield an abundant crop was
the habit of the Bohemian peasant, until
Christian teaching influenced him for the
better; yet such a hold had the tradition
of his ancestors over him that the custom
still survives, and yearly on Good Friday
before sunrise he enters his garden, and
there on his knees says&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I pray, O green tree, that God may make thee good."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The old form ran thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I pray thee, O green tree, that thou yield abundantly."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In some districts the lash of the Bohemian
peasant's whip is well applied to the bark of
the tree, reminding one of the terse verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A woman, a spaniel, and walnut tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more you beat them the better they be."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></div></div></div>

<p>There is also something akin, in this
Bohemian's former sentiment, to the wish
our nursery children make while eating
apples. Coming to the cores they take out
the pippins and throw them over the left
shoulder, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pippin, pippin, fly away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring me an apple another day."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Surely a tree hidden within its fruit.</p>

<p>In the German fairy tale of Ashputtel,
also known as the golden slipper&mdash;a similar
legend is extant amongst the Welsh people&mdash;and
from which our modern tale of
Cinderella and her glass slipper came,
a tree figured as the mysterious power.
After suffering many disappointments Ashputtel,
so the legend relates, goes to a hazel
tree and complains that she has no clothes
in which to go to the great feast of the king.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 12em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shake, shake, hazel tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold and silver over me,"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></div></div></div>

<p>she exclaims, and her friends the birds
weave garments for her while the tree makes
her resplendent with jewels of gold and
silver.</p>

<p>"Children's sport, popular sayings, absurd
customs, may be practically unimportant, but
they are not philosophically insignificant,
bearing as they do on primitive culture."<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
Trans-Alpine Europe was a greater mystery
to the nations on the littoral of the Mediterranean
at the time of Christ's appearance in
Syria than any spot in Central Africa is to
us to-day.</p>

<p>Across the Northern mountain chains
were regions unaffected by Greek or Roman
culture, and the only light shed on the
memorials of Northern Europe's early youth
comes from the contributory and dimly illuminative
rays of folk-lore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE BABY'S RATTLE</h3>

<p>at this juncture is worth according a passing
notice, though degenerated into the bauble
it now is.</p>

<p>Among the Siberian, Brazilian, and Redskin
tribes it was held as a sacred and
mysterious weapon. This sceptre of power
of the modern nursery&mdash;the token primitive
man used, and on which the Congo negro
takes his oath&mdash;has lost its significance.</p>

<p>The Red Indian of North America had
his Rattle man, who, as physician, used it
as a universal prescription in the cure of
all disease, believing, no doubt, that its
jargon would allay pain, in like manner as
it attracts and soothes a cross child; and
this modern type of primitive man, the Red
Indian, although fast dying out, has no
obscured visions of the records of childhood;
they have remained since his <i>anno mundi</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
ran back to zero. To him the great sources
of religious and moral suasion which gave
birth to medi&aelig;val and modern Europe, and
so largely contributed to the polity of Asia
and the upraising of Africa, have been
a dead letter, which spell his extinction.
He lived up to his racial traditions, and is
fast dying with them. His language, his
arts, his religious rites are of an unfamiliar
past.</p>

<p>Leaving the Red Indian moon worshipper
with his death rattle awhile and
harking back to Europe, Norway stands
out as the richest country in legendary
lore, for old-time superstitions have lingered
among the simple and credulous people,
living pent up on the horrid crags, where
torrents leap from cliff to valley. Their
tales of goblins and spirits, tales of trolls,
gnomes, and a legendary host of other uncanny
creatures, point to the former nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and ancestral worship of a people cut off
from the advancing civilisation of their time.
Luckily for the arch&aelig;ologist, superstitious
beliefs and folk-lore tales have preserved
the graves of the Stone Age inhabitants
of the country from desecration. As in
Norway so in the Isle of Man, and in the
western districts of Ireland.</p>

<p>In Man until the fifties many of the inhabitants
believed in the Spirit of the
Mountains; indeed, even in County Donegal
and the West Riding of Yorkshire,
up to the last twenty years, fairy superstition
was rife. Boyd Dawkins gives in
his chapter, "Superstition of the Stone Age:
Early Man in Britain," an account of an
Isle of Man farmer who, having allowed
investigation to be made in the interests
of science on portions of his lands, becoming
so awed at the thought of having sanctioned
the disturbing of the dead, that he actually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
offered up a heifer as a burnt sacrifice to
avert the wrath of the Manes. After lunar
and solar worships this ancestral worship
of the Isle of Man farmer ranks next in
point of age, a survival of which is seen
in the respect paid by country people to
the fairies, the goblins, and the elves.
Equally so has the spirit of former beliefs
been handed down to us in the song of
the nurse, and in the practices of rural
people.</p>

<p>A modernised lullaby of a Polish mother
bears traces in the last stanza of a quasi-native
worship&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shine, stars, God's sentinels on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Proclaimers of His power and might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May all things evil from us fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O stars, good-night, good-night!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Other instances of nature worshippers
are amusing as well as being instructive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
The Ojebway Indians believe in the mortality
of the sun, for when an eclipse takes
place the whole tribe, in the hope of rekindling
the obscured light, keep up a
continual discharge of fire-tipped arrows
from their bows until they perceive again
his majesty of light. Amongst the New
Caledonians the wizard, if the season continue
to be wet and cloudy, ascends the
highest accessible peak on a mountain-range
and fires a peculiar sacrifice, invoking his
ancestors, and exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sun, this I do that you may be burning hot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eat up all the black clouds of the sky,"<br /></span>

<p>Wind-making among primitive people
was universally adopted; even at a late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
period the cultured Greeks and Romans
believed in a mythical wind god.</p>

<p>It was the custom of the wind clan of
the Omahas to flap their overalls to start
a breeze, while a sorcerer of New Britain
desirous of appeasing the wind god throws
burnt lime into the air, and towards the
point of the compass he wishes to make
a prosperous journey, chanting meanwhile
a song. Finnish wizards made a pretence
of selling wind to land-bound sailors. A
Norwegian witch once boasted of sinking
a vessel by opening a wind-bag she possessed.
Homer speaks of Ulysses receiving
the winds as a present from &AElig;olus, the
King of Winds, in a leather bag.</p>

<p>In the highlands of Ethiopia no storm-driven
wind ever sweeps down without
being stabbed at by a native to wound
the evil spirit riding on the blast. In some
parts of Austria a heavy gale is propitiated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
by the act and speech of a peasant who,
as the demon wings his flight in the
raging storm, opens the window and casts
a handful of meal or chaff to the enraged
sprite as a peace offering, at the same
time shouting&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There, that's for you; stop, stop!"<br /></span>

<p>A pretty romance is known in Bulgarian
folk-lore. The wife of a peasant who had
been mysteriously enticed away by the
fairies was appealed to by her husband's
mother to return.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who is to feed the babe, and rock its cradle?"<br /></span>

<p>No wonder this purposeless lullaby is
satirised in the orthodox libretto of Punch's
Opera or the Dominion of Fancy, for Punch,
having sung it, throws the child out of the

<p>The lullaby of the Black Guitar, told by
the Grimm brothers in their German fairy

<p>The old English cradle rhyme, evidently

<p>This last recalls the esteem our Teuton
ancestors had for their scalds, or polishers
of language, when poetry and music
were linked together by the voice and harp
of minstrelsy, and when the divine right to
fill the office of bard meant the divine
faculty to invent a few heroic stanzas to

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">To</span> the kingdom of elf-land few English
nursery poems have any reference.
Our continental neighbours have preserved
a few, but the major number are found in
versions of the folk-lore tales belonging
to the people dwelling in the hilly districts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of remote parts of Europe. Norway,
Switzerland, Italy, and even Poland present
weird romances, and our own country folk
in the "merrie north country," and in the
lowlands of "bonnie Scotland," add to the
collection. The age to which most of
them may be traced is uncertain; at all
events, they bear evidences of belonging
to a period when nature worship was
universal, and the veneration of the mysterious
in life common to our ancestors.
The Second Stone Age men, it is said, cremated
their dead who were worthy of
reverence, and worshipped their shades,
and the nursery tales of pixies and goblins
and elves are but the mythical remains of
their once prevailing religion&mdash;universal the
world over. The inception of this ancestral
worship probably took place during that
period known as the Neolithic Age, when
the moon, stars, and sun no longer remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the mysterious in life to be feared and worshipped.
In the dreary process of evolution
a gradual development took place, and nature
worship and ancestral veneration evolved
into the more comprehensive systems of
Buddha, Confucius, and the later polytheism
of Greece, Ancient Tuscany, and
Rome, leaving high and dry, stranded, as
it were, in Northern Europe, Ireland, and
North Britain, an undisturbed residuum of
ante-chronological man's superstitions. Evidences
of primitive man's religion are seen
in the customs and practices of our rural
folk to-day.</p>

<p>In vast forest districts, or in hilly regions
far away from the refining influences of
social contact, the old-time superstitions
lingered, changing little in the theme, and
inspiring the succeeding generations, as
they unfolded in the long roll-call of life,
with the same fears of the mystery of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
death and of a future life. One of the
customs of recent practice is fitly described
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In Yorkshire and in north-west Irish
homesteads, and even far away in the East
amongst the Armenian peasantry, a custom
was, until late years, in vogue, of providing
a feast for the departed relatives on certain
fixed dates. All Hallows' Eve being one
of the occasions a meal was prepared, and
the feast spread as though ordinary living
visitants were going to sit round the "gay
and festive board." The chain hanging
down from the centre of the chimney to the
fireplace was removed&mdash;a boundary line
of the domestic home&mdash;but at these times
especial care was taken to remove it so that
the "pixies and goblins and elves" could
have a licence to enter the house. In spite
of Christian teaching and other widening
influences the belief remained fixed in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
minds of the rural classes that elves,
goblins, sprites, pixies, and the manes were
stern realities.</p>

<p>The Erl King of Goethe, a sprite endowed
with more than human passions, elegantly
portrays the modern idea of an old theme.
How he haunted the regions of the Black
Forest in Thuringia, snatching up children
rambling in the shades of the leafed wood,
to kill them in his terrible shambles. The
King of the Wood and the Spirit of the
Waters were both early among the terrors
of old-time European peasantry's superstitions.</p>

<p>Another surviving custom, carried out
with much picturesque ceremony, is common
to the peoples of the Balkan States. In
time of water-famine, more particularly
in Servia, the girls go through the neighbouring
villages singing a Dodolo song
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We go through the village,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clouds go in the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We go faster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faster go the clouds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have overtaken us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wetted the corn and wine."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Precisely as the hawthorn bushes were
stripped of their blossoms by Maying
parties in England in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, so in Servia the ballet
of the leaf-dressed girl, encircled by a
party of holiday-makers, proceeds through
the hamlets invoking not the Fair Flora,
but the Spirit of the Waters; the central
figure, the girl in green, being besprinkled
by each cottager.</p>

<p>The Greeks, Bulgarians, and Roumanians
observe a similar ceremony, but on the
confines of Russia so intense is the belief
in the superstition of the water goblin
that in times of long drought a traveller<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
journeying along the road has often been
seized by the ruthless hands of the
villagers and ceremoniously flung into
a rivulet&mdash;a sacrifice to appease the spirit
that lay in the waters. In Ireland the
fairy-tale of Fior Usga&mdash;Princess Spring-water&mdash;has
a kindred meaning; she, so the
legend relates, sank down in a well with
her golden pitcher, and the flood-gates
opened and swamped the parched and
barren countryside near Kinsale.</p>

<p>In Germany, when a person is drowned,
people recollect the fancies of childhood,
and exclaim, "The River Spirit claims its
yearly sacrifice." Even the hard-reasoning
Scotch, years ago, clung to the same superstitious
fancy which oftentimes prevented
some of the most selfish of their race from
saving their drowning fellows. "He will
do you an injury if you save him from the
water" was one of their fears. In England,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
too, the north-country people speak of the
River Sprite as Jenny Greenteeth, and children
dread the green, slimy-covered rocks on
a stream's bank or on the brink of a black
pool. "Jenny Greenteeth will have thee if
thee goest on't river banks" is the warning
of a Lancashire mother to her child.</p>

<p>The Irish fisherman's belief in the Souls'
Cages and the Merrow, or Man of the Sea,
was once held in general esteem by the men
who earned a livelihood on the shores of the
Atlantic. This Merrow, or Spirit of the
Waters, sometimes took upon himself a half-human
form, and many a sailor on the rocky
coast of Western Ireland has told the tale
of how he saw the Merrow basking in the
sun, watching a storm-driven ship. His
form is described as that of half man, half
fish, a thing with green hair, long <i>green
teeth</i>, legs with scales on them, short arms
like fins, a fish's tail, and a huge red nose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
He wore no clothes, and had a cocked hat
like a sugar-loaf, which was carried under
the arm&mdash;never to be put on the head unless
for the purpose of diving into the sea. At
such times he caught all the souls of those
drowned at sea and put them in cages
made like lobster pots.</p>

<p>The child's tale of the German fisherman
and his wife tells the same story&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Man of the Sea, come list unto me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Alice, my wife, the plague of my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath sent me to beg a boon of thee."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Unless such past credulities as these be
considered it would be most difficult to
account for many of the sayings of child-days,
and the archaic ideas that have drifted
into our folk-lore tales. On all hands it is
admitted that it is no unusual thing to find
a game or practice outliving the serious
performance of which it is an imitation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
The condition of a people who originally
held such mystic and crude ideas is seen
to-day in types of aborigines and uncivilised
races.</p>

<p>In Halmahero, a large island to the west
of New Guinea, a wizard goes through a
ceremony somewhat similar to the Servian
village maid's. Cutting down branches, he
dips them into the water and sprinkles the
parched ground.</p>

<p>In Ceram the outer barks of certain trees
are cast on the surface of running streams
and rivulets and dedicated to the spirits
that lie in the waters, that after this offering
they may arise from the depths of the
deep and clothe the earth with a cloud
of mist.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE CORN SPIRIT.</h3>

<p>Another spirit, dreaded by all European
peoples, was the Spirit of the Corn. In
Russia especially children of the rural class
sing songs of a very distant age, mother
handing down to child themes unexposed
to foreign influence. It is true the Church
has altered the application of many by
dressing up afresh pagan observances in
Christian costumes. There are several, but
one of the songs of the Russian serf to
his prattling offspring illustrates this statement.
Before reading it, it should be borne
in mind that Ovsen is the Teutonic <i>Sun
God</i> who possessed a boar, and that the
antiquity of the song belongs to a time
when the Russian peasant's forefathers worshipped
the glories of the heavens, deifying
the Sun for his fire and lustre.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The translation of this poem of the
fire worshippers is taken from Ralston's
<i>Songs of the Russian People</i>, and runs as
follows. Imagine the crooning voice of the
old Slav woman singing it to her nurse
child.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the forest, in the pine forest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There stood a pine tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Green and shaggy.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh Ovsen! Oh Ovsen!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Boyars came,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cut down the pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sawed it into planks,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fastened it with nails.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh Ovsen! Oh Ovsen!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who will go<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Over the bridge?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ovsen will go there,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the New Year.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh Ovsen! Oh Ovsen!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>Another song asks&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 11em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On what will he come?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On a dusky swine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What will he chase?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A brisk little pig."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The present singers of songs about Ovsen
receive presents in lieu of the old contributions
towards a sacrifice to the gods.
The habit is to ask in some such words
as these&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Give us a pig for Vasily's Eve."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Pigs' trotters used to be offered as a
sacrifice at the beginning of the New Year,
and the custom still prevails in Russia of
proffering such dishes at this time. The
compliments of the season are commemorated
by giving away the feet of the "brisk
little pig." The first day of the New Year
was Ovsen's day, but now consecrated to
the memory of St. Basil the Great. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
previous evening was called St. Basil's
Eve, or Vasily's Eve. In one of the little
Russian songs it is said&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ilya comes on Vasily's Day,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>meaning on St. Basil's, or New Year's Day,
comes the Sun-god, or thunder-bearer,
originally Pevan, who, under Christian influences,
becomes Elijah, or Ilya.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 13em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ilya comes on Vasily's Day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He holds a whip of iron wire,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And another of tin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither he comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thither he waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Corn grows."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This supports the inference that the agriculturist
was a nature worshipper. But
quite apart from sun worshippers, and their
songs about corn-growing, the children of
the rural classes in many other parts of
Europe have fixed ideas, or beliefs, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
"Spirit of the Cornfield"; their sayings are
represented by different figures, "a mad dog
in the corn," "a wolf in the corn," are found
amongst the many shibboleths of the youngsters
playing in the fields prior to harvest-time.
That they dread the wavy movement
of the grain-laden stalks is certain, and the
red poppy, the blue cornflower, the yellow
dandelion, and the marguerite daisy, although
plucked by tiny hands on the fringe of the
fields, it is not often tiny feet trample down
the golden stalks. At nightfall, in Germany,
an old peasant, observing the gentle undulating
motion of the ripe crop while seated
before his cottage, will exclaim&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 26em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There goes the rye-wolf. The wolf is passing through the corn."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In some parts the "corn spirit" was said to
be a cow.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 11em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The cow's in the corn."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p>In one of our home counties&mdash;Hertfordshire&mdash;it
is a "mare," and the custom of
"crying the mare" has allusion to the corn
spirit, and is spoken of in some villages
to-day. There are several rhymes that carry
a notice of cornfield games.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Ring a ring a rosies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A pocket full of posies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hush!&mdash;The Cry?&mdash;Hush!&mdash;The Cry?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All fall down."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<hr />

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Little boy blue come blow me thy horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sheep in the meadow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The cow's in the corn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is the boy that looks after the sheep?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Under the haystack fast asleep."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The "Little Boy Blue" rhyme, it has
been urged, had only reference to the
butcher's boy. The rhyme is very much
older than the blue-smocked butcher's boy,
and in truth it may be said the butcher
boy of a century ago wore white overalls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The former rhyme, "Ring a Ring a
Rosies," is known in Italy and Germany.
In the northern counties of England the
children use the words, "Hushu! Hushu!"
in the third line.</p>

<p>The Spirit of the Cornfield is dreaded
by children of all European countries. In
Saxon Transylvania the children gather
maize leaves and completely cover one of
their playmates with them. This game is
intended to prefigure death.</p>

<span class="i2">Do paint the meadows with delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cuckoo then, on every tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mocks married men, for thus sings he&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Cuckoo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cuckoo! cuckoo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O word of fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unpleasing to the married ear!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus is cuckoo gossip perpetuated in
rhyme and song; but an old belief in the
mysteriously disappearing bird gave an
opportunity to children to await its return
in the early summer, and then address to
it all kinds of ridiculous questions.</p>

<p>"How many years have I to live?" is
a favourite query. The other like that of
the Lithuanian maid, "Shall I soon be
married?" meets with favour amongst single
girls.</p>

<p>A German song, entitled "The Shepherd
Maiden," indicates this custom. The words
being&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A shepherd maiden, one fine day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Two lambs to pasture led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To verdant fields where daisies grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bloomed the clover red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There spied she in a hedge close by<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A cuckoo, call with merry cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<p>After chasing the immortal bird from
tree to tree to have her question, "Shall
I soon be married?" answered, the song
concludes with this taunting refrain&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Two hundred then she counted o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The cuckoo still cried as before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In our earliest published song, words and
music composed by John of Forsete, monk
of Reading Abbey, date 1225, and entitled
"Sumer is icumen in," the cuckoo is also
extolled&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 27em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Summer is a-coming in, loudly sing, cuckoo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Groweth the seed, bloweth the mead, and springeth wood anew.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sing, cuckoo! Merry sing, cuckoo,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The peasantry of Russia, India, and
Germany contribute to the collection of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
cuckoo-lore. Grimm mentions a Cuckoo
Hill in Gauchsberg. The cuckoo and
not the hill may have had the mystic
sense.</p>

<p>Identical with this Cuckoo Hill, in its
solemn significance, there occurs a passage
in the game of Hot Cockles, played
formerly at Yorkshire funerals.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where is the poor man to go?"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>the friends whine, and the mutes who are
in readiness to follow the coffin beat their
knees with open hands and reply&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Over the Cuckoo Hill, I oh!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The association of ideas about the prophetic
notes of the cuckoo's mocking voice&mdash;in
matters of marriage and death&mdash;are
pretty general, and there are still further
many points of identity in the tales told by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the children of India and Southern Russia.
Like the Ph&#339;nix idea amongst the people
of Egypt, Persia, and India, these traditions
allegorise the soul's immortality.</p>

<h3>A WORD ON INDIAN LORE.</h3>

<p>The old prose editions of the sacred books
of India&mdash;the law codes of the Aryans&mdash;were
suitably arranged in verse to enable
the contents to be committed to memory
by the students. In these rules the ritual
of the simplest rites is set forth. New and
full moon offerings are given, and regulations
minutely describing as to the way salutation
shall be made.</p>

<p>Much after the fashion of the grandees
or the Red Indian moon worshipper of
North America, it is told how a Br&acirc;hmana
must salute stretching forth his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
right hand level with his ear, a Kshalriza
holding it level with the breast, a S&ucirc;dra
holding it low&mdash;all caste observances and
relics of a sign-language.</p>

<p>"A householder shall worship gods, manes,
men, goblins, and rishis," remains of ancestral
worship. "Adoration must be given to
him who wears the moon on his forehead,"
the oldest known form of worship, possibly,
of the Drift-man's period, "and he shall
offer libations of water, oblations of clarified
butter, and worship the moon." The butter
oblation was practised by the Celts! They
have a lunar penance, "he shall fast on the
day of the new moon."</p>

<p>These observances belonged to a people
who, without doubt, migrated from the West
to the East. The manes and goblins are pre-Celtic,
and have likewise been preserved
by those who travelled, as the journey
became possible, towards Asia. Some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
our nursery tales, children's games, are likewise
known to them. The same legends
are extant in the East and West, all of which
have a common origin, and that a religious
one.</p>

<h3>GAMES.</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> annual calendar of dates when
certain of the pastimes and songs of
our street children become fashionable is an
uncertain one, yet games have their seasons
most wonderfully and faithfully marked.
Yearly all boys seem to know the actual
time for the revivification of a custom,
whether it be of whipping tops, flirting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
marbles, spinning peg-tops, or playing tip-cat
or piggy. This survival of custom
speaks eloquently of the child influence on
civilisation, for the conservation of the
human family may be found literally portrayed
in the pastimes, games, and songs
of the children of our streets.</p>

<p>Curious relics of past cruelties are
shadowed forth in many of the present
games&mdash;some of which are not uninteresting.
The barbarous custom of whipping martyrs
at the stake is perpetuated by the game of
whip-top. In a black-letter book in the
British Museum, date 15&mdash;(?) occurs this
passage&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I am good at scourging of my toppe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would laugh to see me morsel the pegge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon one foot I can hoppe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dance trimly round an egge."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The apprentices of the London craftsmen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
followed the popular diversion of cock-throwing
on Shrove Tuesday and tossing
pancakes in the frying-pan&mdash;the latter custom
is still kept up at Westminster School. Both
bear allusion to the sufferings and torments
of men who died for conscience sake.</p>

<p>Dice and pitch-and-toss, also modern
games of the present gutter children, in
primitive times were the ways and means
adopted by the learned to consult the
oracles. Much in the same way the Scotch
laddie and wee lassie play&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dab a prin in my lottery-book;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dab ane, dab two, dab a' your prins awa',"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>by sticking at random pins in their school-books,
between the leaves of which little
pictures are placed. This is the lottery-box,
the pictures the prizes, and the pins
the forfeits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Another favourite Scotch game is&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A' the birds of the air, and the days of the week."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Girls' pleasures are by no means so
diversified as those of boys. It would be
considered a trifle too effeminate were the
little men to amuse themselves with their
sisters' game of Chucks&mdash;an enchanting
amusement, played with a large-sized marble
and four octagonal pieces of chalk. Beds,
another girlish game, is also played on the
pavement&mdash;a piece of broken pot, china
or earthenware, being kicked from one of
the beds or divisions marked out on the
flags to another, the girls hopping on one
leg while doing so. It is a pastime better
known as Hop Scotch, and is played in
every village and town of the British Isles,
varying slightly in detail. The rhymes
used by street children to decide who is to
begin the game are numerous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The Scotch version of a well-known one
is given below&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Zickety, dickety, dock, the mouse ran up the nock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nock struck one, down the mouse ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Zickety, dickety, dock."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Anery, twaery, tickery, seven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aliby, crackeby, ten or eleven;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pin pan, muskidan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tweedlum, twodlum, twenty-one."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Amongst the notable men in the world's
history who have depicted children's games,
St. Luke the Evangelist tells in a pleasant
passage of how Jesus likened the men of
His day to children sitting in the market-place
and calling to their playmates&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have mourned unto you, and ye have not wept."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A vivid picture, illustrating puerile peevishness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>In the thousands of years that street
plays have been enacted by the youngsters,
no poet's, philosopher's, nor teacher's words
have been more to the point. Every
child wants to take the most prominent
part in a game, but all cannot be chief
mourners, else there will be no sympathising
weepers.</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who'll be chief mourner? I, said the dove,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll mourn for my love."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>To-day things are better arranged, a
counting-out rhyme settles the question of
appointment to the coveted post. Like
the</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Zickety, dickety, dock, the mouse ran up the clock"<br /></span>

<p>of the north-country children.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whoever I touch must be he"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>ends and begins the counting-out verse of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the Southern youngsters, which runs as
follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All good children go to heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mother says the last one I touch must be he."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Of the numerous variations of this rhyme
the one at present in demand by London
children is&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All good children go to heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A penny on the water, twopence on the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threepence on the railway, and out goes she."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another and more generally known rhyme
of&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 12em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"1, 2, 3, 4,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Eating cherries off a plate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">5, 6, 7, 8,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>is also used for the same purpose.</p>

<p>But are there no peevish children to-day?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
None sulking in nursery or playground over
games just as the little Israelites did 1900
years ago in the market-place at Nain?</p>

<p>Remember the lesson of old&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We have piped, and ye have not danced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have mourned to you, and ye have not wept."<br /></span>

<h3>MARRIAGE GAMES.</h3>

<p>In India and Japan marriage ceremonies
bear a feature of youthful play. Amongst
the Moslems in the former country&mdash;where
the doll is forbidden&mdash;the day previous to
a real wedding the young friends of the
bridegroom are summoned to join in a
wedding game. On the eve of the day
they all meet and surround the bridegroom-elect,
then they make for the house of the
bride's parents. On arrival at the gates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the bride's relatives shut the doors and
mount guard.</p>

<p>"Who are you," exclaims the bridegroom,
"to dare obstruct the king's cavalcade?
Behold the bridegroom cometh! Go ye
not out to meet him?" The answer comes
from within the abode. "It is a ruse&mdash;so
many thieves roam about, more than probable
you and your band are of them."</p>

<hr />

<p>In England in 1557 the boys of London
town sang a rhyme at their mock wedding
feasts of&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If ever I marry I'll marry a maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To marry a widow I'm sore afraid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For maids are simple and never will grudge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But widows full oft as they say know too much."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This song was entered at the Stationers'
Hall, 1557 <span class="smcapl">A.D.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></span></p>

<h3>LONDON STREET GAMES.</h3>

<h4>A WEDDING.</h4>

<p>After the preliminary rhyme of&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All good children go to heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A penny on the water, twopence on the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threepence on the railway, and out goes she,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>has been said, the lot falls on one of the
girls to be the bride. A ring is formed and
a merry dance begins, all the children
singing this invitation&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 25em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Choose one, choose two, choose the nearest one to you."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The girl bride then selects a groom from
the rest of the other children. He steps into
the centre of the ring, joins hands and kisses
her, after which, collecting a posy from each
of the others, he decorates her with flowers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and green leaves. A fresh ring is now
formed&mdash;figuratively the wedding ring; the
whole of the children caper round singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rosy apple, lemon and pear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bunch of roses she shall wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold and silver by her side,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I know who shall be my bride."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; daughter."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<h4>THE KING OF THE BARBARINES.</h4>

<p>In this street game an entire regal court
is appointed, the children taking the
characters of king, queen, princes, and
courtiers. When these preliminaries are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
settled two children join hands and whisper
something&mdash;supposed to be a great state
secret&mdash;to each other. This at once causes
a rivalry amongst certain of the mock
courtiers, and the dissatisfaction spreads,
culminating in an open rebellion. The
children take sides. Things now look
serious; the prime minister tells the king
he fears rebellion, and for safety his little
majesty, attired in royal robes, and wearing
a paper crown, retires to his palace&mdash;one
of those places "built without walls." The
soldiers, the king's bodyguard, are summoned,
and orders are given to them to
suppress the insurrection and capture the
little rebels. As each one is taken prisoner
the soldiers ask&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 25em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Will you surrender? Oh, will you surrender<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the King of the Barbarines?"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>During the struggle reinforcements come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
up from the rebel camp and try to beat off
the king's soldiers, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 25em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We won't surrender, we won't surrender<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the King of the Barbarines."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We'll make you surrender, we'll make you surrender<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the King of the Barbarines."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You can't make us surrender, you can't make us surrender<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the King of the Barbarines."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We'll go to the King, we'll go to the King,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the King of the Barbarines."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You can go to the King, you can go to the King,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the King of the Barbarines."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The rebels now build an imaginary castle
by joining hands. The king's soldiers surround
the place, and after a skirmish break
it down.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 25em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We'll break down your castle, we'll break down your castle<br /></span>

<p>Two rows of lassies and lads face each
other; the boys, hand in hand, move
backwards and forwards towards the girls,
saying&mdash;</p>

takes places to the characteristic chorus

<h3>"PRAY, MR. FOX, WHAT TIME IS IT?"</h3>

<p>A child stands on a hillock, or slightly
elevated ground. A party of children, hand
in hand, approach him whom they denominate
Mr. Fox with the question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pray, Mr. Fox, what time is it?"</p>

<p>"One o'clock," answers Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>They are safe and fall back to their den.</p>

<p>Making another venture they repeat the
question.</p>

<p>"Twelve o'clock," shouts Mr. Fox, at the
same time bounding towards them and
scattering them in all directions. Those
he can catch before they get back to their

until one remains, who of course becomes

the sly, foxy answer to the question, "Pray,
Mr. Fox, what time is it?"</p>

<h3>"MOTHER, BUY ME A MILKING CAN."</h3>

<p>A boisterous game, played by girls, especially
favoured in Paddington and Marylebone.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mother, buy me a milking can, A, I, O.<br /></span>

<p>At the time of saying "serve you right"
all the children scamper away from the girl
who acts the part of mother. It is little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
more than a mild reproof on the over-indulgent
mother who would sell or give
anything to satisfy the fancies of her
children, and the "serve you right" is a
girl's idea of what a foolish mother deserves&mdash;less
impudent than corrective.</p>

<p>comes into fashion with all the reckless
frivolity of early years, when the old
English festivities of Maying take place,
reminding one of the old custom of bringing
the May-pole from the neighbouring
woods, when each of the eighty oxen yoked
to the May-pole waggon had a nosegay of
wild-flowers tied to the horns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The examination is finished, for one of
the fatal replies has been given. The child
who exclaimed "Yes" goes to a den. After
taking all the children through the same
form of questioning the youngsters are
found divided into two classes, those who
avoided answering in the prohibited terms,
"Yes," "No," "Nay," "Black," "White,"
"Grey," and the little culprits in the den or
prison who have failed in the examination.
The tug-of-war now begins, either class
being pitted against the other. No rope is
used; arms are entwined round waists, skirts
pulled, or coat-tails taken hold of.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h3>"CAN I GET THERE BY CANDLE-LIGHT?"</h3>

<p>This is one of the most universally played
chain games in the British Isles. It belongs
as much to the child with a rich Dublin
brogue as to the Cockney boy, one thing
being altered in the verse&mdash;the place, "How
many miles to Wexford or Dublin" being
substituted for Wimbledon. Coventry and
Burslem take the child fancy in the North of
England.</p>

<p>It probably dates from Tudor times. The
expression, "Can I get there by candle-light?"
and "He went out of town as far
as a farthing candle would light him," were
amongst the common sayings of the people
of Elizabeth's time.</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How many miles to Wimbledon?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Three score and ten.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Can I get there by candle-light?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yes! and back again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then open the gates and let me go.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not without a beck and a bow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here's a beck and there's a bow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now open the gates and we'll all pass thro'."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The chain of children first formed to play
this game is re-formed into two smaller ones.
Hands are then uplifted by one of the sides
to form an archway; the other children,
marching in single file, approach the sentinel
near the gateway of arched hands and ask&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

alert enough pass through, but others are

<p>The enthusiasm with which children of

parents, and be rewarded by the tears of joy
their mirth and laughter will cause.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>It is played after this fashion. However,
it will not be amiss to remove the tea-things
before anything is attempted. All seated,
the parent or nurse then places the first and
second fingers of each hand on the coverlet,
the youngsters imitating her. Everybody's
fingers are now moved up and down in a
perpendicular way, like the needle of a
sewing machine. All singing&mdash;</p>

<h4>"ANOTHER NURSERY TABLE GAME, BUT
NEARLY 300 YEARS OLD."</h4>

<p>Some of the thousands of the nursery
tales in vogue come to us without a trace
as to their origin. In James I.'s time the
ending of ballads ran with a tuneful</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 10em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fa, la, la, la, lal, de."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>A collection of ballads in book-form by
John Hilton, and called "Garlands," are also
described as the "Ayres and Fa las" in the
title-page.</p>

<p>Halliwell gives "The tale of two birds
sitting on a stone" the same date. It is
scarcely a tale, but a game still played by
all classes of children&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There were two birds sitting on a stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fa, la, la, la, lal, de.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One flew away, and then there was one,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fa, la, la, la, lal, de.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other flew after, and then there was none,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fa, la, la, la, lal, de.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so the poor stone was left all alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fa, la, la, la, lal, de!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The way boys play it may be briefly told
as follows:&mdash;Pieces of paper are wetted and
fixed on the fingers, the first finger of each
hand. Being thus ornamented, they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
placed on the table or knee, and the rhyme
repeated&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There were two birds sitting on a stone."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then by a sudden upward movement, throwing
the paper on one finger, as it were, over
the shoulder, the next finger&mdash;the second&mdash;is
substituted for it, and the hand is again
brought down and placed beside the remaining
paper bird&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fa, la, la, la, lal, de."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"One flew away, and then there was one."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The same sleight-of-hand is gone through
with the other finger&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The other flew away, and then there was none,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And so the poor stone was left all alone."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another but more modern game, embodying
the same idea, is told in&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There were two blackbirds sitting on a hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One named Jack and the other named Jyll.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly away, Jack, fly away, Jyll.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come again, Jack, come again, Jyll"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>to the wonderment of the child watching the
quick change of fingers.</p>

<p>It is the earliest sleight-of-hand trick
taught to the nursery child.</p>

<h4>A B C GAME.</h4>

<p>A spirited game may be played after this
fashion. All seated round the table or fireplace.
One child sings a solo&mdash;a verse of
some nursery rhyme. For instance&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hi diddle diddle,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The cat and the fiddle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The cow jumped over the moon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little dog laughed to see such fine sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the dish ran away with the spoon."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A chorus of voices takes up the tune and
the solo is repeated, after which the alphabet
is sung through, and the last letter, Z, sustained
and repeated again and again, to
bother the next child whose turn it now is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to sing the next solo. The new solo must
be a nursery rhyme not hitherto sung by any
of the company. If unable to supply a fresh
rhyme the child stands out of the game and
pays forfeit.</p>

<h4>"I APPRENTICE MY SON."</h4>

<p>In another parlour game of a rather interesting
kind the youngest in the room
begins by saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I apprentice my son to a butcher; the first thing he sold was a pound of M."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Each has a turn to guess what M may
stand for&mdash;some kind of meat the butcher
usually sells. Should the first person in the
circle guess the correct meaning, it becomes
his or her turn to ask the next question.
Baker or grocer, chemist or draper, in fact
any trade may be selected by the person
whose turn it is to put the question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<h4>AN ARMENIAN CHILD'S GAME</h4>

<p>of a thousand years ago is still played by
the Christian children of Asia. Like our
Western street games of tops and tip-cats
it perpetuates the cruelties of the persecutions
which their ancestors suffered, a most
terrible instance of the child's game outliving
the serious performance of that which it
represented. The frontier of the Armenian
kingdom had been destroyed by one of the
Christian Byzantine emperors, thus enabling
the Seljouck Turks to pass through the
Armenian kingdom, and deal out to the
unoffending Asiatic Christians the terrors
of pillage by firing their peaceful homesteads.
England, France, and Germany
have a modification of the game. In France
the youngsters hand round a burning faggot,
exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 13em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Petit bonhomme vit encore."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>German children play a similar game with
a stick instead of a firebrand, and Halliwell
gives the rhyme describing the English
game as&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jack's alive and in very good health,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he die in your hand you must look to yourself."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<h4>RUSSIAN SUPERSTITION.</h4>

<p>An old custom of the Russian maiden&mdash;identical
with the English girl's habit on
St. Valentine's Day&mdash;is still in vogue.
Going into the street she asks the first
man she meets his Christian name, believing
that her future husband will be sure to
bear the same.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>JEWISH RHYMES.</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Sports</span>, games, and amusements were
unknown until a late day in Jewish
history. Within the walls of Jerusalem, or
indeed throughout the whole length of
Palestine, no theatre, circus, hippodrome,
nor even gallery was to be found, until
Jason, the Greek-Jew of the Maccabees
dynasty, became ruler, and built a place of
exercise under the very tower of the
Temple itself. (2 Macc. iv. 10-14.) Herod
subsequently completed what Jason had
begun, and erected a hippodrome within
the Holy City to the delight of the younger
Hebrews, later building another at C&aelig;sarea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Even the festivals were not of Mosaic
appointment, and it is not difficult to understand
how certain gloomy censors and
theologians condemn merriment. To serve
the Lord with gladness was quite an after-thought
of the Israelitish leaders and
teachers. But when the great fairs or
wakes of the whole nation were held, pastimes
and diversions crept in similar to
the merry meetings of our own times, and
religion, commerce, and amusement became
the cardinal features of the great Jewish
fairs.</p>

<p>The Guy Fawkes Festival of Judaism,
the Purim Feast, appointed by Esther and
Mordecai, commemorating deliverance from
massacre which Hamar had determined by lot
against them, gave occasion for relaxation.
Even the most austere and gloomy rejoiced,
while the younger people abandoned themselves
to dissolute mirth, opposite sexes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
dressing up in the clothes of each other;
a habit at present in favour amongst the
coster fraternity of East London on Bank
Holidays. The Jews were a peculiar people.
No old-time imagery of the older nations
enchanted them; they were carefully taught
to live for themselves and by themselves,
but to make their profit out of others whenever
possible to do so. The spoiling of
the Egyptians took place more than once
in their history. Whatever nation they
colonised amongst had to enforce strict laws
and rigid punishments in defence of their
own less shrewd people.</p>

<p>Even their nursery rhymes are distinctive,
full of religious and national sentiment, and
may be counted on the fingers of one hand.
They necessarily know the ones in common
use belonging to the country of their adoption,
but so important are the two Hebrew rhymes
considered to be that every pious Jew teaches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
his child their significance. A translation of
the principal one, found in the Sepher
Haggadah, a Hebrew hymn in the Chaldee
language, runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Recitative.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A kid, a kid, my father bought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For two pieces of money&mdash;A kid! a kid!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<hr class="w10" />
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then came the cat and ate the kid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That my father bought for two pieces of money.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the dog and bit the cat that ate the kid that my father bought for two pieces of money.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the staff and beat the dog that bit the cat, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the fire that burned the staff, that beat the dog, that bit the cat, that ate the kid, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the water and quenched the fire, that burned the staff, that beat the dog, that bit the cat, that ate the kid, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the ox and drank the water, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the butcher and slew the ox, that drank the water, etc.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the Angel of Death and killed the butcher, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the Holy One, Blessed be He! and slew the Angel of Death, that killed the butcher, that slew the ox, that drank the water, that quenched the fire, that burned the staff, that beat the dog, that bit the cat, that ate the kid, that my father bought for two pieces of money&mdash;A kid! a kid!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now for the interpretation&mdash;for it is a
historical and a prophetic nursery rhyme.
The kid which Jehovah the father purchased
denotes the select Hebrew race; the
two pieces of money represent Moses and
Aaron; the cat signifies the Assyrians, by
whom the ten tribes were taken into captivity;
the dog is representative of the
Babylonians; the staff typifies the Persians;
the fire is Alexander the Great at the head
of the Grecian Empire; the water the
Roman domination over the Jews; the
ox the Saracens who subdued the Holy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Land and brought it under the Caliph; the
butcher is a symbol of the Crusaders'
slaughter; the Angel of Death the Turkish
power; the last stanza is to show that God
will take vengeance on the Turks when
Israel will again become a fixed nation and
occupy Palestine. The Edomites (the
Europeans) will combine and drive out
the Turks.</p>

<p>Everyone, big and little, will recognise
the source of the nursery fable of "The
house that Jack built."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This is the house that Jack built.<br /></span>

<p>A Scotch and North of England nursery
tale, two centuries old, is cast in the same
mould, or rather built on the hymn of the
Hebrews found in the Sepher Haggadah.
It is given below.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There was an old woman swept her house and found a silver penny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she went to market and bought a kid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when she came to drive it home kid would not go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She went a little further and met a stick, and said to it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Stick, stick, beat kid, kid won't go, 'tis a'most midnight, and hame I must go.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the stick would not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She went a little further and met a fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Fire, fire, burn stick, stick won't beat kid, kid won't go, 'tis a'most midnight, and hame I must go.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fire would not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She went a little further and met with water.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Water, water, quench fire, fire won't burn stick,' etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the water would not.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She went a little further and met an ox.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ox, ox, drink water,' etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She went a little further and met a butcher, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She went a little further and met a rope, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She went a little further and met some grease, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Grease, grease, grease rope.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She went a little further and met a rat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Rat, rat, eat grease,' etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She went a little further and met a cat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Cat, cat, kill rat,' etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cat began to bite the rat, the rat began to eat the grease, the grease began to grease the rope, the rope to hang the butcher, the butcher to kill the ox, the ox to drink the water, the water to quench the fire, the fire to burn the stick, the stick to beat the kid, and so the kid went home."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In other accounts of the same tale the
kid is a pig, the silver penny a crooked
sixpence; the pig would not go over the
stile, and the old woman could not get her
old man's supper ready.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The several prefigurations are not difficult
to make out. Very many of the babblings
put into the mouths of English children are
of foreign origin; the story of "The Kid"
was known in Leipsic and sung by German
children in 1731, very possibly coming in
this way from the Jewish colony.</p>

<p>In Denmark it is also a favourite with
the school children.</p>

<p>The other Jewish rhyme, kept in remembrance
by modern Jews, is printed at the
end of their Passover Service in English
and in Hebrew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>AN ANCIENT ENGLISH RHYME</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">From</span> which came the well-known
nursery tale of&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A frog, who would a-wooing go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hey, oh! says Rowly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether his mother would let him or no,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a Rowly Powly Gammon and Spinach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hey, oh! says Anthony Rowly."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In 1549 the Scottish shepherds sang a
song, entitled "The frog that came to the
myl dur." In 1580 a later ballad, called
"A most strange wedding of a frog and
a mouse," was licensed by the Stationers'
Company. There is a second version extant
in <i>Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The following was commonly sung in the
early years of Henry VIII.'s reign:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 29em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It was a frog in the well, Humbledum, humbledum,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the merry mouse in the mill, Tweedle, tweedle, twino.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frog he would a-wooing ride, Humbledum, humbledum,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sword and buckler by his side, Tweedle, tweedle, twino.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When upon his high horse set, Humbledum, humbledum,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His boots they shone as black as jet, Tweedle, tweedle, twino.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then he came to the merry mill-pin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, 'Lady mouse, be you within?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then out came the dusty mouse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, 'I'm the lady of this house.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Hast thou any mind of me?' asked the gallant Sir Froggy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I have e'en great mind of thee,' her ladyship replied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Who shall make our marriage?' suggested the frog.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Our lord, the rat!' exclaimed the mouse.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
<span class="i0">'What shall we have for supper?' the thoughtful frog exclaimed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Barley, beans, and bread and butter!' generously replied Miss Mouse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the supper they were at,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frog, the mouse, and the rat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In came Gib, our cat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And caught the mouse by the back;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then did they separate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frog leapt on the floor so flat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In came Dick, our drake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drew the frog into the lake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rat ran up the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so the company parted all."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The rhyming tale of "The frog who
would a-wooing go" is similar in every way
to the above.</p>

<p>In Japan one of the most notable fairy-tales
relates a story of a mouse's wedding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<h3>SONGS OF LONDON BOYS IN TUDOR
TIMES.</h3>

<p>In the next two reigns, Edward VI. and
Philip and Mary's, the musical abilities of
the London boy were carefully looked after
and cultivated. The ballads he sang recommended
him to employers wanting apprentices.
Christ's Blue Coat School and
Bridewell Seminary offered unusual facilities
for voice training. One happy illustration
of the customs of the sixteenth
century was the habit of the barber-surgeon's
boy, who amused the customers, waiting for
"next turn" to be shaved or bled, with his
ballad or rhyming verse; and a boy with
a good voice proved a rare draw to the
"bloods" about town, and those who frequented
the taverns and ordinaries within
the City.</p>

<p>In the next reign the condition of the
poor was much improved; the effect of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
land sales in Henry VII.'s reign, when
the moneyed classes purchased two-thirds of
the estates of the nobility, and spent their
amassed wealth in cultivating and improving
the neglected lands. This factor&mdash;as
well as the cessation of the Wars of the
Roses&mdash;was beginning to work a lasting
benefit to the poor, as the street cries of 1557
show, for, according to the register of the
Stationers' Company that year, a licence
was granted to John Wallye and Mrs. Toye
to print a ballad, entitled&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Who lyve so mery and make such sporte<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As they that be of the poorest sort?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who liveth so merry in all the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As doth the poor widow who selleth the sand?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever she singeth, as I can guess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Will you buy my sand&mdash;any sand&mdash;mistress?'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6"><i>Chorus.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who would desire a pleasanter thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all the day long to do nothing but sing?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who liveth so merry and maketh such sport<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As those who be of the poorer sort?"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p>Even Daniel De Foe, writing one
hundred and twenty years after, paid a
passing tribute to Queen Elizabeth, and
said "that the faint-hearted economists of
1689 would show something worthy of
themselves if they employed the poor to
the same glorious advantage as did Queen
Elizabeth."</p>

<p>Going back to the centuries prior to
the Tudor period, one is reminded that
all the best efforts at minstrelsy&mdash;song,
glee, or romance&mdash;came from the northern
counties, or from just on either side the
borders.</p>

<p>The prevalence of a northern dialect
in the compositions show this suggestion
to be in a great degree real. The poems
of minstrelsy, however, claim something
more than dialect&mdash;the martial spirit,
ever fever-heat on the borders of the
kingdoms of England and Scotland; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
age of chivalry furnishing the minstrel
with the subject of his poem.</p>

<p>But with the strife of war ended, on
Henry VII.'s accession, ballads took the
place of war-songs in the heart affections
of the people, and they sang songs of
peace and contentment. Bard, scald, minstrel,
gleeman, with their heroic rhymes
and long metrical romances, gave way in
the evolution of song and harmony to
the ballad-monger with his licence. However,
in turn they became an intolerable
nuisance, and a wag wrote of them in
1740&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of all sorts of wit he's most fond of a ballad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But asses choose thistles instead of a salad."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another of the wayside songs of Henry
VIII.'s time, sung by man, woman, and
child, ran&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quoth John to Joan, Wilt thou have me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I prithee, now wilt? and I'se marry with thee<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<span class="i0">My cow, my calf, my house, my rents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all my land and tenements&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, say, my Joan, will that not do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot come each day to woo.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've corn and hay in the barn hard by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And three fat hogs pent up in a sty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have a mare, and she's coal black;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ride on her tail to save her back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have cheese upon the shelf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I cannot eat it all myself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've three good marks that lie in a rag<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the nook of the chimney instead of a bag."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The London surgeon-barber's boy pleased
his master's patrons with a whole host of
similar extravagances, but he was not alone
in the habit, for so usual was it for the
poorest of the poor to indulge in mirth,
that literary men of the day wrote against
the practice.</p>

<p>In a black-letter book&mdash;a copy of which
is in the British Museum, date 1560&mdash;and
entitled, "The longer thou livest more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
fool thou art," W. Wager, the author, says
in the prologue&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Good parents in good manners do instruct their child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Correcting him when he beginneth to grow wild."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The subject matter of this book also
gives a fair view of the customs and habits
of the boys of that age. In the character of
Moros, a youth enters the stage, "counterfeiting
a vain gesture and foolish countenance,
singing the 'foote' or burden of many
songs, as fools are wont."</p>

<p>Amongst the many rhymes enumerated
by Moros, which he claims were taught
to him by his mother, occur: "Broome
on the hill," "Robin lend me thy bow,"
"There was a maid came out of Kent,"
"Dainty love, dainty love," "Come o'er the
bourne, Bessie," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tom a Lin, and his wife and his wife's mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They all went over the bridge together;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bridge was broken and they fell in,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'The devil go with all,' quoth Tom a Lin."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another version, more particularly the
Irish one, runs&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bryan O'Lynn, and his wife and wife's mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All went over the bridge together;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bridge was loose, they all fell in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What a precious concern,' cried Bryan O'Lynn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bryan O'Lynn had no breeches to wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he got a sheep's skin to make him a pair."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This rhyme is evidently much older than
the Tudor age, and one is reminded of the
time when cloth and woollen goods were not
much used by the lower classes. The
Tzigane of Hungary to-day wears his sheep-skin
breeches, and hands them down to
posterity, with a plentiful supply of quick-silver
and grease to keep them soft and
clean. "Bye baby bunting" and the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
"hare skin" is the other nursery rhyme
having a reference to skins of animals being
used for clothing. But "Baby bunting"
has no purpose to point to, unless indeed
the habits of the Esquimaux are taken in
account. In the list of nursery songs sung
by children in Elizabeth's reign, the following
extract from "The longer thou livest the
more foole thou art" gives four:&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>CAT RHYMES.</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> old saying of "A cat may look at
the queen" is thus expressed in a
dialogue between a ward nurse of Elizabeth's
time and a truant tom on its return to the
nursery.</p>

<p>No doubt the incident giving rise to

fright Queen Bess is supposed to have
had on discovering a mouse in the folds
of her dress&mdash;for it was she of virgin fame
to whom pussy-cat paid the visit. It has
been asked again and again, "Why are
old maids so fond of cats?" and "Why
are their lives so linked together?" Maybe
it is to scare, as did the cat in the rhyme,
"a little mouse from under her chair."</p>

<h4>CAT TALE OF DICK WHITTINGTON.</h4>

<p>This legend of Dick Whittington is of
Eastern origin. The story of the poor
boy whose ill-fortune was so strangely reversed
by the performances of his cat and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
its kittens finds a parallel in a cat tale found
in "Arlott's Italian Novels," published 1485.
The Lord Mayor of London bearing the
name of Richard Whittington was a knight's
son, a citizen of London, and never poor.
The possible explanation of the cat in
the career of Whittington of London had
reference to a coal-boat known as a "cat,"
and far more likely to make a fortune for
the future Lord Mayor than a good mouser
would be.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>A CRADLE SONG OF THE FIRST
CENTURY.</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Many</span> authorities pronounce this lullaby
to be of the earliest Christian
era. Some believe that in times of yore the
Virgin herself sang it to the infant Jesus.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Sleep, O son, sleep,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Come murmuring to thy heavenly ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thousands of praises we sing to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A thousand thousand thousands.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"May nothing be wanting to thee,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thousands of praises we sing to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A thousand thousand thousands."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>If aught be distinct in this early Christian
lullaby, it is that old-time ideas of "stars on
high," "the sky is full of sleep," and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
similar figures of mythical word-pictures are
wanting. A mother's sympathy and affection
alone bind together the words of her song
in illimitable praises&mdash;a thousand thousand
thousands.</p>

<p>Milton says&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 13em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But see the Virgin blest<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Thee in all children, the eternal child. Thee
to whom the wise men gave adoration, and

<p>What countless hosts of child-bands are ever

their child King.</p>

<p>In the pastoral district of Vallauria, in the
heart of the Ligurian Alps, within a day's
journey from the orange groves of Mentone,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a yearly festival takes place, when the children
of the mountains sing a stanza recalling
the Virgin's song&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If thou wishest for music I will instantly call

</div></div></div>

<p>No lyrics of the nursery have come
down to us fashioned after the first-century
song of the Virgin. The older types have
survived, and in such an unvarying mould
have they been cast that there is in each
European country's song the same old
pagan imagery obstinately repeating itself
in spite of Christianity, so that the songs
of the Christian Church became exclusively
the hymns of her faithful people, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
carols of her festivals, and in the Middle
Ages the libretto of her Church mystery
plays, setting forth her history and doctrines
to the lower orders. If one were to remove
the obstacles of idiom and grammar in the
poetry of France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
Switzerland, or even Russia, and expose
the subject of the theme, a mere skeleton
of past delusions would remain.</p>

<p>Long before modern European nations
received this imagery of past credulities
the poets of Greece and Rome had versified
the same old-time beliefs. Before Rome
was founded the Etruscan race, who
flourished in what is now modern Tuscany,
had the Books of the Tages fashioned in
rhythmical mould, from which their traditions,
ordinances, and religious teachings
were drawn. They believed in genii as
fervently as a Persian. Here is one
Etruscan legend of the nursery, recalling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"How the wondrous boy-Tages sprang out of
the soil just previously turned over by the plough
in the fields of Tarquinii, and communicated to
Lucamones the doctrines of divination, by
sacrifice, by flight of birds, and by observation
of the lightning, a son of genius and grandson
of Jupiter."&mdash;<i>Cic. de Divin.</i> ii. 23.</p></div>

<p>It was the ancient tale of "Jack and the
Beanstalk."</p>

<hr class="w65" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>JACK RHYMES.</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> the preceding chapter it was noted
how the wondrous boy-Tages was
believed in by the ancients. "Jack and
the Beanstalk," our modern tale, though
adapted to the present age, is the same
legend, and known and told in their own
way by the Zulus in South Africa and by
the Redskin of North America, as well as
to other isolated peoples. In these tales
of primitive peoples the same wonderful
miracle of the soil's fertility takes place,
in the one case by the birth of the boy-Tages,
in the other by the marvellous
growth of the twisting beanstalks which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in one night reach up&mdash;up&mdash;up to the
land of the gods and giants. "Jack the
Giant Killer," a similar legend but from
a Celtic source, was known in France
in the twelfth century, and at that period
translated into Latin by Geoffrey of Monmouth.
Both "Jack and the Beanstalk"
and "Jack the Giant Killer" are found in
the folk-lore tales of Scandinavia.</p>

<h4>ANOTHER JACK OF THE NURSERY
CLASSICS</h4>

<p>sprang up into being after the wars
of Parliament, when the pleasure-hating
Puritan gained an ascendency in the land,
and when the pastimes of all classes, but
more especially those of the lower orders
who had been so happy and contented
under the Tudor sovereigns, suffered a
miserable suspension. They who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in authority longed to change the robe
of revel for the shroud. Not only were
theatres and public gardens closed, but
a war of bigotry was waged against
May-poles, wakes, fairs, church music,
fiddles, dancing, puppet shows, Whitsun
ales&mdash;in short, everything wearing the
attire of popular amusement and diversion.
The rhyme recording Jack Horner's gloomy
conduct was, in fact, a satire on Puritanical
aversion to Christmas festivities.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 26em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jack Horner was a pretty lad, near London he did dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father's heart he made full glad, his mother loved him well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pretty boy of curious wit, all people spoke his praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a corner he would sit on Christmas Holy-days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When friends they did together meet to pass away the time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, little Jack, he sure would eat his Christmas pie in rhyme,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And say, 'Jack Horner, in the corner, eats good Christmas pie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his thumb pulls out a plum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, What a good boy am I.'"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The copy of the history of Jack Horner,
containing his witty pranks and the tricks
he played upon people from his youth to
old age, is preserved in the Bodleian
Library.</p>

<p>There are a number of men and women
who recall a time when the rhymes of
"Jack Horner" and "Jack the Giant Killer"
appeared finer than anything in Shakespeare;
but this much may be said for
"Jack Horner," the cavalier's song of derision
at the straight-laced Puritan, that
it soon lost its political signification, gradually
becoming used as a mark of respect.</p>

<p>Plutarch says of Homer that he died
of chagrin, being unable to solve a
riddle.</p>

<p>The Ph&#339;nix myth, once believed in
by the Egyptian priests, is now, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
had even so long ago as in Herodotus'
time, degenerated into a mere child-story
of a bird, who lived, and died, and rose
again from its own ashes. As a relic of
a mysterious faith, this fabulous bird has
come down to us with diminished glory
each century. Old Herodotus, the father
of history, tells us that he saw it once&mdash;not
the bird itself, but a painting of it&mdash;at
Heliopolis, the City of the Sun, in
Egypt. Even this old Greek historian
could not quite believe the current story
in his day concerning this bird; that it
was supposed to revisit the earth after a
five-hundred-year sojourn in the land of
gods was to him, at least, a little strange.
Pliny, the Roman, likewise gives a description
of it. "I have been told," he writes,
"it was as big as an eagle, yellow in
colour, glittering as gold about the neck,
with a body-plumage of deep red-purple.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Its tail is sky-blue, with some of the
penn&aelig; of a light rose colour. The head is
adorned with a crest and pinnacle beautiful
to the sight."</p>

<p>Another ancient retells the story somewhat
different to both the Greek and
Roman historians. Thus runs the Indian
version. Bear in mind, however, before
reading it, that, like the Second Stone Age
people, it was the habit of many races
in India to cremate their dead:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A high funeral pyre is erected of dry
wood, on which the body of the dead is
laid, and in course of time after igniting
the faggots the corpse is consumed. While
this cineration is going on vultures and
carrion fowl not infrequently pounce down
upon the body, and tear away pieces of
flesh from the ghastly, smoking corpse.
These charred parts of the body they
carry away to their nests to feast upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
at leisure. But oftentimes dire results
follow; the home of sun-dried sticks and
litter ignites, and the bird is seen by
some of the superstitious peasantry to
rise up out of fire and smoke and disappear."</p>

<p>Then the Ph&#339;nix fable comes to mind,
"It is the sun-god; he has thrown fire
and consumed the nest, and the old bird,"
and they hastily conclude that the bird
they just now beheld flying away is a
new one, and has, in fact, arisen out of
the ashes they witnessed falling from the
branches of the tall tree. The Ph&#339;nix in
truth!</p>

Grimm brothers, of</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ladybird! ladybird! fly away home,"<br /></span>

<h4>"MY FATHER HE DIED."</h4>

<p>The historical value of nursery rhymes is
incapable of being better illustrated than in
the following old English doggerel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My father he died, I cannot tell how,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left me six horses to drive out my plough,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Jack Straw, blazey boys.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wimmy lo! wimmy lo! wob, wob, wob."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mr. Halliwell dates it as of Richard II.'s
time, and this much may be said for this
opinion, that there is no greater authority
than he on the subject of early English
rhymes and carols. Mr. Halliwell also
believes that of British nursery rhymes it
is the earliest extant. There are those,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
however, who dissent from this view, holding
that many of the child's songs sung to-day
were known to our Saxon forefathers. In
1835 Mr. Gowler, who wrote extensively
on the arch&aelig;ology of English phrases and
nursery rhymes, ingeniously attempted to
claim whole songs and tales, giving side by
side the Saxon and the English versions.
There certainly was a phonetic similarity
between them, but the local value of the
Saxon, when translated, reads in a strange
way, being little more than a protest against
the Church's teaching and influence.</p>

<p>"Who killed Cock Robin?" is given at
length by Mr. Gowler, as well as many
scraps of other nursery rhymes. Mr. Gowler
seemed to claim that though the lettered
language of each succeeding age fashions
afresh, the Baby Kingdom knows no such
vocal revolutions.</p>

<h3>A FAVOURITE NURSERY HYMN.</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Known</span> to the rustics of England,
France, and Italy since the days of
the great Charlemagne, has a peculiar
history. Like many other rhymes of yore
it is fast dying out of memory. The
educational influences of the National
Schools in the former part of this century,
and the Board Schools at a later date,
have killed this little suppliant's prayer,
as well as most of the other rural rhymes
and folk-lore tales handed down by mother
to child.</p>

<p>The hymn, though still used in some
parts of Northern England, and especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
amongst the Nonconformists, as a child's

<p>Leo III. is the supposed author of the
book in which it is found, viz., <i>Enchiridion
Leonis Papae</i>. However, the <i>Enchiridion</i>
was a book of magic, and not authorised by
the Church of Rome, but used by spurious
monks and charlatans, wizards and quacks,
in their exploits amongst the credulous rural
folk. It was full of charms, prayers, and
rhymes to ward off evil spirits. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John verses
are part of the same "Gentle Jesus, meek
and mild." The <i>Enchiridion</i> was first published
in 1532. This hymn was, in the
main, derived from the White Paternoster,
and handed down to posterity and preserved
by the rustics.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>This almost forgotten nursery song and
game of "The Bells of London Town"
has a descriptive burden or ending to each
line, giving an imitation of the sounds of
the bell-peals of the principal churches in
each locality of the City and the old London
suburbs. The game is played by girls and
boys holding hands and racing round sideways,
as they do in "Ring a Ring a Rosies,"
after each line has been sung as a solo by
the children in turns. The</p>

<p>is chorussed by all the company, and then
the rollicking dance begins; the feet
stamping out a noisy but enjoyable accompaniment
to the words, "Gay go up, gay
go down."</p>

<p>The intonation of the little vocal bell-ringers
alters with each line,</p>

<p>suggesting a very slow movement and a
deep, low tone.</p>

<p>The round singing of the ancients, of
which this game is a fitting illustration,
is probably a relic of Celtic festivity. The
burden of a song, chorussed by the entire
company, followed the stanza sung by the
vocalist, and this soloist, having finished, had
licence to appoint the next singer, "canere
ad myrtum," by handing him the myrtle
branch. At all events round singing was
anciently so performed by the Druids, the
Bardic custom of the men of the wand.</p>

<h3>POLITICAL SIGNIFICATIONS OF
NURSERY RHYMES.</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> 1660, when the Restoration of Charles
II. took place, the great procession of
State to St. Paul's Cathedral called forth
this rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come, Jack, let's drink a pot of ale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I shall tell thee such a tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will make thine ears to ring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My coin is spent, my time is lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I this only fruit can boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That once I saw my king!"<br /></span>

<p>A Roundhead sneer at the man in the
street, after the Royalist rejoicings were
over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>In a copy of rhyming proverbs in the
British Museum, written about the year
1680, occurs the following Puritan satire
on Charles II.'s changeability:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A man of words and not of deeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is like a garden full of weeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the weeds begin to grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It's like a garden full of snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the snow begins to fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It's like a bird upon the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the bird away does fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It's like an eagle in the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the sky begins to roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It's like a lion at your door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the door begins to crack,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It's like a stick across your back;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when your back begins to smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It's like a penknife in your heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when your heart begins to bleed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You're dead, you're dead, and dead indeed."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Among Marvel's works (vol. i. pp. 434-5)
a witty representation of the king's style<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of speech is given with the <i>jeu d'esprit</i>
so distinctively peculiar to Marvel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My proclamation is the true picture of my
mind. Some may perhaps be startled and cry,
'How comes this sudden change?' To which I
answer, 'I am a changeling, and that's sufficient,
I think. But, to convince men further that I
mean what I say, these are the arguments. First,
I tell you so, and you know I never break my
word; secondly, my Lord Treasurer says so, and
he never told a lie in his life; thirdly, my Lord
Lauderdale will undertake it for me. I should
be loath by any act of mine he should forfeit
the credit he has with you.'"</p></div>

<p>In England Charles gave his Royal
Indulgence to Dissenters, and granted them
full liberty of conscience. They who had
been horribly plundered and ill-treated now
built meeting-houses, and thronged to them
in public. Shaftesbury, who afterwards
became a Papist, exclaimed, "Let us bless
God and the king that our religion is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
safe, that parliaments are safe, that our
properties and liberties are safe. What
more hath a good Englishman to ask,
but that the king may long reign, and
that this triple alliance of king, parliament,
and the people may never be
dissolved?" But Charles had a standing
army in Scotland, with the Duke of
Lauderdale as Lord High Commissioner,
and all classes of people in that country
were obliged to depose on oath their
knowledge of persons worshipping as Dissenters,
on penalty of fine, imprisonment,
banishment, transportation, and of being
sold as slaves. Persecutions of former
times were surpassed, the thumbscrew
and the boot were used as mild punishments,
the rack dislocated the limbs of
those who respected conscience, and the
stake consumed their bodies to ashes.
Villagers were driven to the mountains,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and eighteen thousand Dissenters perished,
not counting those who were accused of
rebellion. He was "a man of words,"
and the rhyme of this period depicts his
whole character.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two of the courtezans of Charles II.'s
time were Lucy Locket and Kitty Fisher.
The following rhyme suggests that Kitty
Fisher supplanted Lucy Locket in Charles'
fickle esteem&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lucy Locket lost her pocket,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kitty Fisher found it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing in it, nothing in it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the binding round it."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>On his death-bed the monarch commended
the Duchesses of Cleveland and Portsmouth
to his successor, and said to James, "Do
not let poor Nelly (Nell Gwynne) starve!"
Even their pockets were as badly lined as
Lucy Locket's.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>The hatred of the Roman Catholic religion
"had become," said Macaulay, "one
of the ruling passions of the community,
and was as strong in the ignorant and profane
as in those who were Protestants from
conviction." Charles II. was suspected by
many of leaning towards the Roman Catholic
religion. His brother, and heir presumptive,
was discovered to be a bigoted Catholic, and
in defiance to the remonstrances of the
House of Commons had married another
papist&mdash;Mary of Modena.</p>

<p>The common people apprehended a return
of the times of her whom they unreasonably
called Bloody Mary. Sons of this marriage,
they feared, meant a long succession of
princes and kings hostile to the Protestant
faith and government by the people. In
1689, when William of Orange became
king in James II.'s place, a political squib
went off in the style of a nursery lullaby,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
entitled "Father Peter's policy discovered;
or, the Prince of Wales proved a Popish
Perkin"&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In Rome there is a fearful rout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what do you think it's all about?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Sing, Lalla by babee, by, by, by."<br /></span>

<span class="i4">To please a pious brother?"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>At the beginning of this present century
the renowned Pastorini contributed his share
to simple rhyming. A writer in the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i> of that period points out
Pastorini as being no less a personage than
the Right Rev. Charles Walmesley, <span class="smcapl">D.D.</span>,
a Roman Catholic prelate, whose false<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
prophecies under the name of Pastorini
were intended to bring about the events
they pretended to foretell&mdash;the destruction
of the Irish Protestants in 1825. Just
previous to this year every bush and
bramble in Ireland had this remarkable
couplet affixed to it&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the year eighteen hundred and twenty-five<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There shall not be a Protestant left alive."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In 1835, when the efforts of the Whig
Ministry to despoil the Irish Church proved
so strong, a writer in the Press caricatured
Lord Grey, Lyttleton, Dan O'Connell,
and Lord Brougham in the following
nursery rhymes. The attempt was ingenious,
but only of small value as showing
the rhymes to be the popular ones of
that day.</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There was an old woman, as I've heard tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She went to the market her eggs to sell."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>And&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Robbin, a bobbin, the big-bellied Ben,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ate more meat than threescore men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He eat a cow, he eat a calf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He eat a butcher and a half;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He eat a church, he eat a steeple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He eat the priest and all the people."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The other rhymes were&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There was an old woman went up in a basket<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ninety-nine times as high as the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where she was going I couldn't but ask it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For in her hand she carried a Brougham!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old woman, old woman, old woman, said I,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why are you going up so high?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sweep the cobwebs off the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But I'll be with you by-and-by."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<hr />

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Old Mother Bunch, shall we visit the moon?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, mount on your broom, I'll stride on the spoon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hey to go, we shall be there soon!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This rhyme was sung at the time in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
derision to Earl Grey's and Lord Brougham's
aerial, vapoury projects of setting the
Church's house in order.</p>

<p>"Lord Grey," said the satire-monger,
"provided the cupboards and larders for
himself and relatives. He was a paradoxical
'old woman' who could never keep quiet."</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There was an old woman, and what do you think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Victuals and drink were the chief of her diet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet this old woman could never keep quiet."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As a prototype of reform this old woman
was further caricatured as Madame Reform.</p>

<p>The going "up in a basket ninety-nine
times as high as the moon" referred to
Lord Grey's command to the English
bishops to speedily set their house in
order. The ascent was flighty enough,
"ninety-nine times as high as the moon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to sweep the cobwebs off the sky"&mdash;in other
words, to set the Church, our cathedrals and
bishops' palaces in order&mdash;and augured well;
but this old woman journeyed not alone, in
her hand she carried a broom (Brougham).
It may have been a case of ultra-lunacy this
journey of ninety-nine times as high as the
moon, and "one cannot help thinking," said a
writer of that period, "of the song, 'Long
life to the Moon'; but this saying became
common, 'If that time goes the coach, pray
what time goes the basket?'"</p>

<p>The "Robbin, a bobbin, the big-bellied
Ben" parody alluded to Dan O'Connell;
the butcher and a half to the Northamptonshire
man and his driver; eating "church"
and "steeple" meant Church cess.</p>

<p>O'Connell certainly did cut the Church
measure about. In his curtailment he
would not leave a room or a church for
Irish Protestants to pray in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Little dog" refers to Lyttleton in the
nursery rhyme, for when the under-trafficing
came to light, Lord Grey, it is said, was so
bewildered at his position that he doubted
his own identity, and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If I be I, as I suppose I be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, I've a 'Little dog,' and he'll know me!"<br /></span>
